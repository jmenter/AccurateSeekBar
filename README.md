A more accurate SeekBar for Android

The SeekBar widget in Android is great for quickly choosing arbitrary values but doesn't do so well when the user wants precision. Enter AccurateSeekBar.

The way it works is thus: when the user drags the SeekBar with their finger, the SeekBar thumb tracks at a 1:1 ratio (just like normal.) But, if the user drags their finger vertically, the thumb starts tracking more slowly and accurately. The accuracy is proportional to vertical distance. Give it a try!
